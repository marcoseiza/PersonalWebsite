# Starting Out With Rust and Svelte Using Tauri

[![Tauri Banner](https://tauri.app/img/social.png)](https://tauri.app/ "banner")

I've been wanting to check out
[![icon](https://www.rust-lang.org/static/images/safari-pinned-tab.svg) Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/ "icon-text-link") 
for a long time now, especially after already
being comfortable with languages, like C++, that have no garbage collector. Rust's
new take on an imperative language fascinated me, especially since it allows for
so many functional programming paradigms. 

I remember learning Ocaml, a functional programming language, and being frustrated by the roundabout ways of doing imperative 
"like" functionality. It was so verbose to write and complicated to wrap your 
head around it. Rust, on the other hand, is imperative from the start and grabs
the best parts of functional programming languages like Ocaml:
immutability, functions as first-class citizens, iterators and combinators, 
pattern matching, great error handling, and the best part, clear concepts of ownership.


To learn Rust I decided to use 
[![icon](https://tauri.app/meta/favicon-96x96.png) Tauri](https://tauri.app/ "icon-text-link")
, a framework to build desktop applications with a Rust backend and regular Javascript frontend.
It's like Electron, but not Chromium :). Having a Javascript frontend, also allowed me to
start out with Svelte. I built a simple TodoList app, which you can download below.

## Rust Basics

While researching Rust, I found this amazing article by Amos
[A half-hour to learn Rust](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust).
It covers all the important things to know about Rust. But here are a couple things
that I learned on top of that.

### Advanced `Option` Handling:

The most basic way to deal with `Option` is using `match` or `if` statements, 
or just `unwrap` and `panic!` the program.

```rust
let x: Option<i32> = Some(3);
let y: 4;

let x_plus_y: Option<i32> = match x {
  Some(x) => Some(x + y),
  None => None
}
// or:
let x_plus_y: Option<i32> = if x.is_some() {
  x + y
} else {
  None
}

// Will crash if x is None;
let x_plus_y: i32 = x.unwrap() + y;
```

However, I found that you can use some wonderful functional combinatorial 
ways to manage `Option`, using `and`, `and_then`, `or`, and `or_else`.

```rust
let x: Option<i32> = Some(3);
let y: i32 = 4;

// This is the same as the `match` and `if` statements above.
let x_plus_y: Option<i32> = x.and_then(|x| x + y);
```

``` rust
let x: Option<i32> = Some(3);
let y: Option<i32> = None;
assert_eq!(x.and(y), None);
assert_eq!(x.or(y), Some(3));
```
``` rust
let x: Option<i32> = None;
let y: Option<i32> = Some(10);
assert_eq!(x.and(y), None);
assert_eq!(x.or(y), Some(10));
```
``` rust
let x: Option<i32> = Some(3);
let y: Option<i32> = Some(10);
assert_eq!(x.and(y), Some(3));
assert_eq!(x.or(y), Some(10));
```

So CLEAN ðŸ˜Œ. In a way it mimics the implicit undefined and null handling of 
javascript with its implicit boolean conversions.

  ```ts
  let x: number | undefined = 3;
  let y: number | undefined = undefined;
  assert_eq(x && y, undefined);
  assert_eq(x || y, 3);
  ```
  ```ts
  let x: number | undefined = undefined;
  let y: number | undefined = 10;
  assert_eq(x && y, undefined);
  assert_eq(x || y, 10);
  ```
  ```ts
  let x: number | undefined = 3;
  let y: number | undefined = 10;
  assert_eq(x && y, 3);
  assert_eq(x || y, 10);
  ```
</details>

### Deriving Traits Using Macros

In Rust, you will frequently see the following macro above `structs`:

```rust
#[derive(Default, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct FooBar {
  ...
```

This macro automatically defines the traits inside the `derive(...)` method. So
whenever I handle `FooBar` I can use methods in the `Default`, `Clone` and `Copy`
traits. 

I ran into some problems while using this macro in my own `structs` and it took
me some time to figure out how to solve it. This macro traits assume that any field
within the `struct` implements the same traits. This is important, as some common
native data structures do not implement some of these traits. For example, `String`
and `Vec` do not implement `Copy`. So when your struct has a field of type 
`String`, and try to derive from `Copy` it will give you an error.

```rust
// This will throw a compilation Error. 
// Because String does not implement Copy.
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct FooBar {
  zar: String,
}
```
```rust
// Instead, you'll have to only implement `Clone`
// and manually call `clone()` when "copying" it.
#[derive(Clone)]
struct FooBar {
  zar: String,
}

let x = FooBar { zar: String::new() };

let y = x // error! because `Copy` is not implemented.
let y = x.clone() // good :)
```

## Using Tauri and Svelte to Make a Task Tracker

Tauri had some great systems in place to interop between Rust and Javascript.
The ones I mainly used were called `tauri::commands`.

You can register a command in your tauri `main.rs` file with the following.

```rust
#[tauri::command]
fn get_data() -> Data {
  ...
}

#[tauri::command]
fn set_data(data: Data) {
  ...
}

fn main() {
   tauri::Builder::default()
        .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![get_data, set_data])
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

Then in Javascript, you can call it using the `@tauri-apps/api`.

```ts
import { invoke } from "@tauri-apps/api";

interface Data {
  ...
}

let data: Data = await invoke<Data>("get_data");
invoke("set_data", { data: data });
```

This allows for all your computationally expensive things to be done on the rust 
backend which will be much faster than Javascript.
- Call databases
- Do machine learning
- Parse videos
- etc...

We can integrate this with svelte really well by using svelte's built in 
`writable` and `readable` stores:

```ts
// In a new file: `store.ts`
import { writable, type Readable } from "svelte/store";
import { Data } from "backend-types";

export const dataStore : Readable<Promise<Data>> = (() => {
  const { subscribe, set } = writable<Promise<Data>>({ ... })
  
  const reload = async () => {
    set(invoke<Data>("get_data"));
  }

  return {
    subscribe,
    reload
  };
})();
```

```svelte
<!-- In a component file: `component.svelte` -->
<script lang="ts">
import { dataStore } from "store";
</script>

// await dataStore promise then display
{#await $dataStore}
  <p>Loading...</p>
{:then data}
  <pre>Data: {data}</pre>
{/await}
<!-- Button hot reloads component with new data. -->
<button on:click={dataStore.reload} >reload</button>
```

This component system hot reloads whenever `dataStore.reload()` is called. A 
wonderful way to make your front end reactive to backend data fetching.
